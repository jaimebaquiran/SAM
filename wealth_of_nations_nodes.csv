ASWON001,Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith,Curriculum,,1.0.0,An exploration of Adam Smith's foundational work in economics - An Inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,,2025-11-29,2025-11-29,10,,,role_domain: Economics; topic: An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith - How nations generate prosperity and wealth; audience: General public who do not have formal training in economics
WON_001,Division of Labour,Concept,Can explain how breaking down production into specialized tasks increases productivity using everyday examples like a restaurant kitchen where one person cooks another serves and another cleans;Can describe Smith's pin factory example where 10 workers specializing in different steps produce 48000 pins per day while 10 workers each making complete pins alone might produce only 200 pins total;Can identify how specialization allows workers to become more skilled at their specific tasks like how a barista makes coffee faster after making hundreds of cups;Can explain how specialization saves time by eliminating the need to switch between different tasks and tools throughout the day;Can recognize that specialized work leads to the invention of better tools and machines like how assembly line workers developed improvements to speed up car manufacturing,1.0.0,Understanding how breaking down production into specialized tasks increases productivity and drives economic efficiency,,2025-11-29,2025-11-29,,Foundational,
WON_002,How Market Size Enables Specialization,Concept,Can explain that specialization only works when enough customers exist to buy specialized products like how a specialized cupcake bakery needs a large city to survive;Can understand that in small isolated towns people must do many jobs themselves because there aren't enough customers for specialists;Can describe how better transportation (roads shipping internet) allows specialists to reach more customers and therefore specialize further;Can provide examples of how larger markets enable finer specialization such as how large cities have specialized doctors (cardiologists dermatologists) while small towns have general practitioners;Can recognize that expanding access to customers creates opportunities for new specialized businesses and increased productivity,1.0.0,Understanding how the extent of the market determines the degree of specialization possible in an economy,,2025-11-29,2025-11-29,,Foundational,WON_001
WON_003,Capital Accumulation and Investment,Concept,Can explain that capital means saved resources (money tools buildings materials) used to help workers produce goods and services;Can describe how capital accumulation happens when a country produces more than it consumes allowing for savings and investment in new equipment and businesses;Can understand that the amount of capital available determines how many workers can be employed productively like how a farmer needs tractors and tools to employ farm workers effectively;Can recognize that different uses of capital (farming manufacturing retail) employ different amounts of workers and produce different amounts of goods;Can explain using simple examples how businesses must save profits to buy better equipment which then allows them to produce more and employ more workers,1.0.0,Understanding the role of capital accumulation in driving economic growth and productivity,,2025-11-29,2025-11-29,,Foundational,
WON_004,Self-Interest and the Invisible Hand,Concept,Can explain that when people pursue their own goals (earning income finding good deals) they unintentionally help others and improve society overall;Can describe the 'invisible hand' as the way markets coordinate millions of individual decisions without anyone being in charge like how grocery stores stay stocked without government planning;Can understand that voluntary exchange creates mutual benefits where both the buyer and seller are better off after a transaction;Can explain Smith's famous example: 'It is not from the benevolence of the butcher the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner but from their regard to their own interest';Can provide modern examples of how self-interest leads to positive outcomes such as how competition between smartphone companies leads to better cheaper phones for consumers,1.0.0,Understanding how individual self-interest in free markets leads to beneficial social outcomes,,2025-11-29,2025-11-29,,Intermediate,WON_001
WON_005,How Prices Naturally Regulate Themselves,Concept,Can distinguish between the cost to produce something (including wages profit and rent) and the actual selling price determined by supply and demand;Can explain that prices rise above production cost when demand is high or supply is low and fall below cost when supply is high or demand is low;Can describe how prices naturally move toward the cost of production over time through the self-correcting mechanism of supply and demand;Can understand that high prices attract more producers to enter the market which increases supply and brings prices back down;Can recognize that low prices cause some producers to exit the market which reduces supply and brings prices back up using examples like seasonal produce or popular toys during holidays,1.0.0,Understanding the natural price mechanism and how market forces regulate prices through supply and demand,,2025-11-29,2025-11-29,,Intermediate,WON_004
WON_006,Productive Work and Economic Growth,Concept,Can distinguish between work that creates lasting goods that add to national wealth (like manufacturing cars or growing food) versus services consumed immediately (like entertainment or personal services);Can explain that the proportion of workers creating lasting goods versus providing immediate services affects how quickly a nation's wealth grows;Can provide contemporary examples: a factory worker building furniture (productive) versus a personal fitness trainer (unproductive in Smith's terms though both are valuable);Can understand that increasing the ratio of workers producing goods relative to total population enhances national prosperity over time;Can recognize that even wealthy nations have many people in service roles and this balance affects the rate of wealth accumulation,1.0.0,Understanding the distinction between productive and unproductive labor and its impact on national wealth,,2025-11-29,2025-11-29,,Intermediate,WON_003
WON_007,Free Trade Benefits All Nations,Concept,Can explain that mercantilism wrongly focused on accumulating gold and silver through trade restrictions confusing money with actual wealth (goods and services);Can describe how free trade allows each nation to focus on what it produces most efficiently and trade for other goods making everyone better off;Can understand that trade restrictions (tariffs quotas import bans) make goods more expensive and reduce overall prosperity for consumers;Can recognize that nations benefit from trade even when one nation is more efficient at producing everything because specialization and exchange still create mutual gains;Can provide simple examples of trade benefits such as how importing bananas from tropical countries and exporting wheat benefits both trading partners,1.0.0,Understanding the benefits of free trade and the problems with mercantilist trade restrictions,,2025-11-29,2025-11-29,,Advanced,WON_004;WON_005
WON_008,Limited but Essential Role of Government,Concept,Can identify Smith's three proper duties of government: protecting the nation from invasion administering justice and protecting property rights and providing public works that benefit everyone;Can explain that government should provide public goods (roads bridges education systems) that benefit society but cannot be profitably provided by private businesses;Can understand that government intervention through monopolies excessive regulations and trade restrictions generally reduces prosperity by preventing efficient markets;Can recognize that infrastructure like highways and ports facilitates commerce but may not be profitable enough for private companies to build without government support;Can describe how government should fund itself through fair taxation while minimizing interference with productive economic activity,1.0.0,Understanding the proper and limited role of government in a market economy,,2025-11-29,2025-11-29,,Advanced,WON_007
WON_009,Innovation and Economic Progress,Concept,Can explain how the division of labour naturally leads workers to discover better methods and invent improved tools for their specialized tasks;Can describe how entrepreneurs drive economic growth by identifying opportunities organizing resources and taking risks to create new products and services;Can understand that innovation increases productivity allowing society to produce more goods with the same amount of work;Can recognize that competition encourages innovation as businesses seek advantages over rivals benefiting consumers through better and cheaper products;Can provide examples of how innovation compounds over time with each improvement enabling further improvements like how better tools led to better machines which led to factories,1.0.0,Understanding how innovation and entrepreneurship drive economic progress and productivity growth,,2025-11-29,2025-11-29,,Advanced,WON_001;WON_003;WON_004
WON_010,Sources of National Wealth Growth,Concept,Can explain that national wealth grows through three main factors: increasing the number of productive workers improving worker skills through specialization and accumulating capital for investment;Can describe how these factors work together such as how capital investment in better tools allows specialized workers to be more productive;Can understand that nations become wealthier over time when they produce more than they consume save the surplus and invest it in productive capacity;Can recognize that removing barriers to trade protecting property rights and maintaining peace create conditions for wealth growth;Can identify that sustainable prosperity comes from increasing productive capacity rather than simply accumulating money or precious metals,1.0.0,Understanding the fundamental sources of economic growth and national prosperity,,2025-11-29,2025-11-29,,Specialized,WON_001;WON_003;WON_006;WON_007;WON_009
