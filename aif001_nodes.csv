AIF_LL_001,Multiple choice questions - Controlling randomness,,"The student needs to be able to answer correctly: QUESTION 1: Increasing the temperature of LLM output tokens: A) Increases model aggressiveness B) Reduces hallucination outputs C) Limits the vocabulary of outputs D) Increases randomness of outputs. Correct answer is D.;The student needs to be able to answer correctly: QUESTION 2: Adjusting the temperature affects LLM outputs by: A) Flattening the spread of probabilities of possible next tokens B) Selecting the top T (temperature) tokens only C) Normalizing logits so that the sum of them equals 1 D) Keeping only the most likely tokens with a cumulative sum of temperature (T);The student needs to be able to answer correctly: QUESTION 3: Top K selects for the most likely tokens, effectively reducing vocabulary. What is a risk of setting top K too low? A) Looping and repetitive outputs B) Random and unpredictable outputs C) Highly accurate outputs D) Grammatical errors;The student needs to be able to answer correctly: QUESTION 4: An LLM agent keeps hallucinating. Which of the following strategies could mitigate this? A) Increase top K B) Increase temperature C) Reduce the output tokens D) Reduce top p;The student needs to be able to answer correctly: QUESTION 5: Which of the following would make LLM outputs more creative for generating marketing material?
