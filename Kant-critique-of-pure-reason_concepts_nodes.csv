IKCOPR_001,The Critical Method and Kant's Copernican Revolution,Concept,"Explain in 3-4 sentences why human reason falls into contradictions when it pursues questions beyond experience (e.g., the origin of the world, God's existence);State the central aim of the Critique: to determine what reason can and cannot know a priori by examining reason's own faculties;Describe Kant's Copernican Revolution: instead of assuming our cognition must conform to objects, objects must conform to our cognitive faculties;Identify that the critical method establishes both the legitimate claims and the necessary limits of human knowledge;Explain why metaphysics as a science must be grounded in principles that determine the conditions of possible experience rather than claims about things beyond experience",1.0.0,"Understanding the critical method and kant's copernican revolution: Explain in 3-4 sentences why human reason falls into contradictions when it pursues questions beyond experience (e.g., the origin of the world, God's existence)",,2025-12-27,2025-12-27,,Foundational,
IKCOPR_002,A Priori vs. A Posteriori Knowledge and the Problem of Synthetic A Priori Judgments,Concept,"Define a priori knowledge as knowledge independent of all experience and a posteriori knowledge as knowledge derived from experience;Classify 6 given statements as a priori or a posteriori with brief justifications (e.g., '7+5=12', 'the sun will rise tomorrow', 'all bachelors are unmarried');Define analytical judgments as those where the predicate is contained in the subject concept (e.g., 'all bodies are extended') and synthetical judgments as those where the predicate adds new information;Distinguish synthetic a priori judgments (adding new knowledge without experience) from synthetic a posteriori judgments (adding new knowledge through experience);Explain why the possibility of synthetic a priori judgments is the central problem of the Critique, using one example from mathematics (e.g., geometry) or natural science (e.g., causality);Identify that synthetic a priori judgments are necessary for mathematics, pure natural science, and metaphysics to be possible",1.0.0,Understanding a priori vs. a posteriori knowledge and the problem of synthetic a priori judgments: Define a priori knowledge as knowledge independent of all experience and a posteriori knowledge as knowledge derived from experience,,2025-12-27,2025-12-27,,Foundational,
IKCOPR_003,"The Three Faculties of Mind: Sensibility, Understanding, and Reason",Concept,"Identify sensibility as the faculty through which objects are given to us via intuition (immediate, singular representations);Identify understanding as the faculty through which objects are thought via concepts (general, mediate representations);Identify reason as the faculty that seeks systematic unity and generates ideas that extend beyond what understanding can legitimately know;Explain that cognition requires both intuitions (from sensibility) and concepts (from understanding): 'Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind';Describe how sensibility provides the matter of cognition, understanding provides the form through categories, and reason seeks completeness beyond experience;Recognize that the misuse of reason occurs when it attempts to gain knowledge of objects (soul, world-whole, God) independent of sensibility and understanding",1.0.0,"Understanding the three faculties of mind: sensibility, understanding, and reason: Identify sensibility as the faculty through which objects are given to us via intuition (immediate, singular representations)",,2025-12-27,2025-12-27,,Foundational,
IKCOPR_004,Transcendental Aesthetic: Space and Time as Pure Forms of Intuition,Concept,"Define the Transcendental Aesthetic as the investigation of the a priori principles of sensibility, namely space and time;State Kant's four main arguments that space is not derived from experience but is a pure form of outer intuition presupposed by all outer experience;State Kant's four main arguments that time is not derived from experience but is a pure form of inner intuition presupposed by all experience;Explain how space makes synthetic a priori knowledge in geometry possible (e.g., the properties of triangles are known a priori because they depend on the form of space);Explain how time makes synthetic a priori knowledge in arithmetic possible (e.g., counting and succession depend on the form of time);Identify that space and time are not properties of things in themselves but only the forms through which things appear to us",1.0.0,"Understanding transcendental aesthetic: space and time as pure forms of intuition: Define the Transcendental Aesthetic as the investigation of the a priori principles of sensibility, namely space and time",,2025-12-27,2025-12-27,,Intermediate,
IKCOPR_005,Categories and the Table of Judgments,Concept,"Explain that categories are pure concepts of the understanding (not derived from experience) that provide the framework for unifying sensory intuitions into coherent experience;Identify that Kant derives the categories systematically from the logical functions of judgment (the table of judgments);List the four main headings of the categories with one example under each: Quantity (unity, plurality, totality), Quality (reality, negation, limitation), Relation (substance-accident, cause-effect, reciprocity), Modality (possibility, actuality, necessity);Recognize that categories are necessary conditions for any experience to be possible—without them, no object could be thought;Explain that categories can only be legitimately applied to objects of possible experience (phenomena), not to things in themselves (noumena);Describe how categories provide rules for synthesizing the manifold of sensible intuition into unified representations of objects",1.0.0,Understanding categories and the table of judgments: Explain that categories are pure concepts of the understanding (not derived from experience) that provide the framework for unifying sensory intuitions into coherent experience,,2025-12-27,2025-12-27,,Intermediate,
IKCOPR_006,Transcendental Deduction: Justifying the Application of Categories,Concept,Define what a 'transcendental deduction' means: a justification showing that categories have legitimate application to objects of experience (not a logical derivation);Explain the central problem the deduction addresses: how can pure concepts (categories) that are not derived from experience necessarily apply to all objects of experience?;Describe the role of synthesis: the activity of combining and unifying the manifold of intuition according to rules (categories);Explain the 'I think' requirement: all my representations must be capable of being accompanied by the consciousness 'I think' or they would be nothing to me;Distinguish objective unity of consciousness (necessary connection according to categories) from subjective unity (contingent association of ideas);State the conclusion: categories are valid for all objects of experience because experience itself is only possible through the synthetic unity that categories provide,1.0.0,Understanding transcendental deduction: justifying the application of categories: Define what a 'transcendental deduction' means: a justification showing that categories have legitimate application to objects of experience (not a logical derivation),,2025-12-27,2025-12-27,,Intermediate,
IKCOPR_007,Schematism and Principles of Pure Understanding,Concept,"Explain the problem of schematism: how can pure, abstract categories apply to concrete sensible intuitions given in time?;Define a schema as a mediating representation—a rule for producing images in time that connects categories to appearances;Give one example of a schema: the schema of causality is the rule of temporal succession according to a necessary rule (cause must precede effect in time);Identify the four main groups of principles: Axioms of Intuition (all intuitions are extensive magnitudes), Anticipations of Perception (all sensations have intensive magnitude), Analogies of Experience (rules for temporal relations), Postulates of Empirical Thought (modality conditions);Explain one Analogy of Experience in detail: the principle of causality states that all alterations occur according to the law of cause and effect;Recognize that these principles show the concrete payoff of the critical philosophy: they structure all possible experience",1.0.0,"Understanding schematism and principles of pure understanding: Explain the problem of schematism: how can pure, abstract categories apply to concrete sensible intuitions given in time?",,2025-12-27,2025-12-27,,Advanced,
IKCOPR_008,"Transcendental Idealism: Phenomena, Noumena, and the Limits of Knowledge",Concept,"Define phenomena as objects as they appear to us through the forms of sensibility (space and time) and categories of understanding;Define noumena as things in themselves, considered independently of our forms of intuition and categories—objects of a purely intellectual intuition we do not possess;State Kant's doctrine of transcendental idealism: we can only know objects as they appear (phenomena), not as they are in themselves (noumena);State Kant's doctrine of empirical realism: within the realm of experience, objects are genuinely real and our knowledge of them is objective;Explain why human cognition is limited to phenomena: categories require sensible intuition to have content, and we only have sensible intuition of appearances;Identify that noumena serve as a limiting concept to prevent the overextension of categories beyond possible experience;Distinguish transcendental (concerning conditions of possible experience) from transcendent (attempting to go beyond all possible experience)",1.0.0,"Understanding transcendental idealism: phenomena, noumena, and the limits of knowledge: Define phenomena as objects as they appear to us through the forms of sensibility (space and time) and categories of understanding",,2025-12-27,2025-12-27,,Advanced,
IKCOPR_009,Transcendental Dialectic: The Illusions of Pure Reason,Concept,"Define transcendental dialectic as the critique of reason's tendency to generate illusions when it seeks knowledge beyond the limits of possible experience;Identify the three main transcendental ideas that reason naturally generates: the soul (rational psychology), the world as a whole (rational cosmology), and God (rational theology);Explain one paralogism: the fallacious inference from 'I think' to the conclusion that the soul is a simple, immaterial substance;State one antinomy (cosmological contradiction) with both thesis and antithesis: e.g., Thesis—'The world has a beginning in time'; Antithesis—'The world has no beginning and is infinite';Explain Kant's resolution strategy for antinomies: both thesis and antithesis can be false if they wrongly assume the world-whole is a thing in itself rather than an appearance;Describe the critique of rational theology: the ontological, cosmological, and physico-theological arguments for God's existence all fail because they attempt to apply categories beyond possible experience;Distinguish the constitutive use of ideas (illegitimate—treating them as objects of knowledge) from the regulative use (legitimate—using them as guiding principles for systematic inquiry)",1.0.0,Understanding transcendental dialectic: the illusions of pure reason: Define transcendental dialectic as the critique of reason's tendency to generate illusions when it seeks knowledge beyond the limits of possible experience,,2025-12-27,2025-12-27,,Advanced,
IKCOPR_010,The Achievement and Significance of the Critique,Concept,"Explain how the Critique establishes secure foundations for mathematics and natural science by showing they rest on synthetic a priori principles grounded in the structure of human cognition;Identify what the Critique denies: the possibility of speculative metaphysics that claims knowledge of things in themselves (soul, world-whole, God);Identify what the Critique preserves: the regulative use of transcendental ideas to guide scientific inquiry toward systematic completeness;Explain the practical payoff: by limiting knowledge, Kant 'makes room for faith'—moral and religious beliefs are not undermined by theoretical reason;Describe how the critical philosophy serves as a tribunal for reason to examine its own powers, establishing both its legitimate claims and necessary limits;Recognize that the Critique's central achievement is showing that the conditions of possible experience are also the conditions of the possibility of objects of experience",1.0.0,Understanding the achievement and significance of the critique: Explain how the Critique establishes secure foundations for mathematics and natural science by showing they rest on synthetic a priori principles grounded in the structure of human cognition,,2025-12-27,2025-12-27,,Specialized,
