ALGLIFE_003,Rationality Under Constraints and Problem Difficulty,Concept,"Explain why real-world problems involve uncertainty, time pressure, incomplete information, and changing conditions that prevent perfect solutions;Classify a given problem as 'simple enough to optimize exactly' versus 'complex enough to require heuristics' based on time available, number of options, and information completeness;Describe why apparent human 'irrationality' often reflects inherent problem difficulty rather than cognitive failure, using a specific example (e.g., organizing, scheduling, deciding);Identify the assumptions under which an algorithmic solution works optimally and recognize when those assumptions don't hold in real situations;Justify when approximation or 'good enough' solutions are more rational than searching for perfect answers, given search costs and time constraints;Explain why modern computer science emphasizes approximation and probabilistic methods over exhaustive calculation for hard problems",1.0.0,"Understanding rationality under constraints and problem difficulty: Explain why real-world problems involve uncertainty, time pressure, incomplete information, and changing conditions that prevent perfect solutions",,2025-12-16,2025-12-16,,Foundational,
ALGLIFE_004,Optimal Stopping: When to Stop Looking,Concept,"Explain the core optimal stopping dilemma: gathering more information improves decision quality but reduces available options and increases search costs;Apply the 37% rule to a real-world scenario: spend 37% of available time/options exploring to calibrate standards, then commit to the first option that beats all previous ones;Identify the assumptions under which the 37% rule applies (known number of options, random order, no recall, maximizing best choice) and recognize situations where it doesn't apply;Distinguish between the exploration phase (observing to set standards, no commitment) and the commitment phase (taking the first option exceeding your standard);Explain the trade-off between two types of regret: 'the one that got away' (stopping too early) and 'stone left unturned' (being too picky);Given three scenarios (apartment hunting with 30-day limit, interviewing 10 candidates, parking search), calculate the exploration period and describe the commitment strategy",1.0.0,Understanding optimal stopping: when to stop looking: Explain the core optimal stopping dilemma: gathering more information improves decision quality but reduces available options and increases search costs,,2025-12-16,2025-12-16,,Intermediate,
ALGLIFE_005,Explore-Exploit Tradeoff: Balancing New and Known,Concept,"Define the explore-exploit tradeoff as the tension between trying new options (exploration to gather information) and choosing known favorites (exploitation to maximize immediate reward);Identify five real-world situations requiring explore-exploit decisions (e.g., restaurant selection, career moves, reading choices, investment allocation, learning new skills);Explain why both exploration and exploitation are necessary: exploration discovers better options, exploitation capitalizes on current knowledge;Given two time horizons (1 month versus 10 years), choose whether to prioritize exploration or exploitation and justify using remaining time as the key factor;Describe the multi-armed bandit problem as a model for explore-exploit decisions: multiple slot machines with unknown payoffs, limited pulls, goal to maximize total reward;Apply an exploration policy to a personal decision: commit to trying one new option per week/month while maintaining proven favorites, and explain the reasoning",1.0.0,Understanding explore-exploit tradeoff: balancing new and known: Define the explore-exploit tradeoff as the tension between trying new options (exploration to gather information) and choosing known favorites (exploitation to maximize immediate reward),,2025-12-16,2025-12-16,,Intermediate,
ALGLIFE_006,Satisficing: When Good Enough Is Optimal,Concept,"Define satisficing as accepting the first option that meets predetermined criteria rather than searching exhaustively for the optimal solution;Explain why satisficing can be more rational than maximizing when search costs (time, effort, opportunity cost) exceed the expected benefit of finding something better;Set a threshold or minimum acceptable criteria for a decision (e.g., apartment features, job requirements) and demonstrate how it reduces search time and decision fatigue;Identify three situations where the cost of finding the perfect solution outweighs the benefit (e.g., choosing breakfast cereal, picking a movie, selecting a pen);Compare satisficing versus maximizing strategies for the same problem and calculate when satisficing produces better outcomes given realistic search costs;Describe how satisficing reduces analysis paralysis and decision fatigue in everyday life by limiting options considered",1.0.0,Understanding satisficing: when good enough is optimal: Define satisficing as accepting the first option that meets predetermined criteria rather than searching exhaustively for the optimal solution,,2025-12-16,2025-12-16,,Intermediate,
ALGLIFE_007,Sorting and Organization: Making Order,Concept,"Explain why sorting is fundamental: it enables efficient searching, retrieval, and decision-making by imposing structure on information;Apply the principle 'don't sort what you don't search': identify items/information that should remain unsorted because retrieval is infrequent;Compare at least two sorting strategies for physical or digital organization (e.g., alphabetical, by frequency of use, by category) and choose the best for a given scenario;Calculate the tradeoff between time spent organizing versus time saved during retrieval, and determine when organizing is worthwhile;Describe how 'sort on access' (organizing items as you use them) can be more efficient than upfront sorting for dynamic collections",1.0.0,"Understanding sorting and organization: making order: Explain why sorting is fundamental: it enables efficient searching, retrieval, and decision-making by imposing structure on information",,2025-12-16,2025-12-16,,Advanced,
ALGLIFE_008,Caching: What to Keep Close,Concept,"Define caching as keeping frequently or recently used items in fast-access storage while moving less-used items to slower storage;Apply caching principles to physical space: given 20 items and their frequency of use, decide which 5 should be 'cached' (desk, countertop, easy reach) versus stored away, and justify the selection;Explain the Least Recently Used (LRU) principle: items not used recently are least likely to be needed soon, so they should be moved to slower storage first;Identify three real-world caching decisions (e.g., what stays on your desk, phone home screen apps, browser bookmarks) and evaluate whether they follow optimal caching strategies;Describe how caching reduces average retrieval time by optimizing for common cases rather than worst cases",1.0.0,Understanding caching: what to keep close: Define caching as keeping frequently or recently used items in fast-access storage while moving less-used items to slower storage,,2025-12-16,2025-12-16,,Advanced,
ALGLIFE_009,Scheduling and Prioritization: First Things First,Concept,"Identify the key scheduling challenge: multiple tasks competing for limited time, with different deadlines, durations, and importance;Apply 'earliest deadline first' strategy: given 5 tasks with deadlines and durations, produce a schedule that minimizes late completions;Apply 'shortest processing time first' strategy: given tasks without deadlines, order them to minimize average completion time and explain why this reduces overall waiting;Explain the concept of 'thrashing': taking on too many tasks causes constant switching overhead that reduces total productivity, and identify when to say no to new commitments;Compare at least two prioritization heuristics (deadline-based, duration-based, importance-based) and choose the appropriate one for different scenarios;Describe how context-switching costs (time to shift between tasks) should influence how you batch similar activities",1.0.0,"Understanding scheduling and prioritization: first things first: Identify the key scheduling challenge: multiple tasks competing for limited time, with different deadlines, durations, and importance",,2025-12-16,2025-12-16,,Advanced,
